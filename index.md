Hi everyone! My name is Ezenia, and I recently graduated from Harvard College this past February in Electrical Engineering. I’m currently working with the Global R&D Consumer Systems and Architecture team @ Bose Corporation in Framingham, MA. 

On this website you can find some of my projects, my resume, and podcast/blog content **The Current Collective**.

I also love making music, so you can find some of my other work here– a cappella performances and youtube covers! I am currently working on original music and will be uploading my music here as well. 

In my free time, I enjoy reading, crocheting, and learning music production!
